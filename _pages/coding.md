## SEEG Node Selection and DTF Analysis Project
- **Description:** This project focuses on node selection and frequency-domain Dynamic Causal Analysis (DTF) based on SEEG (stereo-electroencephalography) signals. It includes data loading, preprocessing, Energy Ratio (ER) computation, change-point detection, Epileptogenicity Index (EI) calculation, and clustering visualization based on out-degree and in-degree metrics.
- **Code:** [View on GitHub](https://github.com/Lyy-River/SEEG_project)

## Vertigo Structural MRI and Clinical Dataset
- **Description:** An open-access dataset of anonymized structural MRI and associated clinical data from patients with vertigo. Imaging data are organized according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) specification and include T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and FLAIR sequences. Curated clinical variables are provided in accompanying phenotype files.
