Hi! I'm Yangyi Luo (罗阳奕). I received my B.S. degree in Statistics from Hunan University, Changsha, China.

My research interests focus on **brain–computer interfaces (BCI)** and **computational neuroscience**, especially how neural signals can be decoded and integrated across multiple sensory modalities.  

My current work involves **multimodal neural data analysis** (EEG, EMG, sMRI, SEEG), where I apply machine learning and network modeling to understand neural dynamics in brain disorders.  

Looking ahead, I am particularly interested in **closed-loop BCI systems** that combine **VR/AR and human–computer interaction**, and in exploring **olfactory interfaces** as a novel pathway for sensory feedback.  Ultimately, I aim to contribute to the development of **multimodal immersive BCIs** that deepen our understanding of brain–machine integration and enhance human sensory experiences.




## **Interests**

- Brain–Computer Interfaces (BCI)  
- Multimodal neural data: EEG, EMG, sMRI, fMRI, SEEG  
- Neural decoding and multisensory integration  
- Data-driven understanding of brain disorders (epilepsy, vertigo)  
- Machine learning and deep learning
