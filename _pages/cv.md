Education
======
* **Hunan University**, Aug. 2021 -- Jul. 2025  
  *B.S. in Statistics (expected June 2025)*  
  - GPA: 3.6 / 4.0 (A- grade, 88.04/100)  
* **Changjun High School of Changsha**, Aug. 2018 -- Jun. 2021   
 
Research Experience
======
* **MRI-Based Diagnostic Classification and Brain Connectivity Analysis**, Jan. 2025 -- Present  
  *Role: Freesurfer, Brain Network Analysis, Docker, Linux*  
  - Performed structural MRI data analysis and brain network modeling for diagnostic classification.  
  - Preprocessed sMRI data using Freesurfer (skull stripping, cortical reconstruction, parcellation).  
  - Built reproducible environments with Docker to ensure software consistency.  
  - Constructed morphological similarity networks to investigate structural and functional connectivity.  

* **EEG + EMG Hand Gesture Classification**, Dec. 2024 -- Mar. 2025  
  *Role: Signal Processing, Deep Learning, Brain-Computer Interface*  
  - Designed experimental protocol for synchronous EEG–EMG acquisition during hand gestures.  
  - Preprocessed and extracted features (EEG: time–frequency; EMG: time/frequency domain).  
  - Built and compared SVM, RF, CatBoost, CNN, Transformer; fusion boosted accuracy.  
  - Proposed a low-cost wearable BCI using wristband–forehead band system.  

* **Top 10% in Kaggle: Stacking Model Competition**, Aug. 2024 -- Sep. 2024  
  *Role: LightGBM, XGBoost, EfficientNet*  
  - Built pipelines for combining tabular and image data in meta-classification.  
  - Compared ImageNet + LightGBM vs. EfficientNet + stacked models.  
  - Conducted 100+ experiments optimizing hyperparameters and sampling.  
  - Ranked top 10% (bronze medal).  

Internship
======
* **Peking University Changsha Institute for Computing and Digital Economy**, Apr. 2025 -- Jul. 2025  
  *Role: Algorithm Research Intern, Brain-Computer Intelligence and Applied Statistics Center*  
  - Worked on SEEG-based epileptogenic zone localization and connectivity modeling.  
  - Applied Epileptogenicity Index (EI), MVAR, DTF for seizure propagation analysis.  
  - Clustered brain regions into functional roles and visualized DTF/PDC adjacency matrices.  
  - Implemented a Python pipeline for preprocessing, modeling, visualization; packaged into reusable library.
