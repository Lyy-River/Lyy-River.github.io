Education
======
* **Hunan University**, Aug. 2021 -- Jul. 2025  
  *B.S. in Statistics (expected June 2025)*  
  - GPA: 3.6 / 4.0 (A- grade, 88.04/100)  
* **Changjun High School of Changsha**, Aug. 2018 -- Jun. 2021   
 
Research Experience
======
* **MRI-Based Diagnostic Classification and Brain Connectivity Analysis**, Jan. 2025 -- Present  
  *Freesurfer, Brain Network Analysis, Docker, Linux*  
  Performing structural MRI data analysis and brain network modeling for individual-level diagnostic classification.
  - Gained proficiency in Linux systems and server-based computing, enabling efficient operation and resource management for large-scale neuroimaging workflows.Preprocessed structural MRI data using Freesurfer, to get high-quality structural statistic metrics. 
  - Built a Morphometric Similarity Network (MSN) to extract topological features and used Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) to learn representations from the original matrices; integrated both feature sets for classification.
  - Conducted group-level statistical analysis to associate subtype-specific brain regions with clinical profiles and neurobiological interpretations, revealing potential structural biomarkers for disease heterogeneity.

* **EEG + EMG Hand Gesture Classification**, Dec. 2024 -- Mar. 2025  
  *Signal Processing, Deep Learning, Brain-Computer Interface*  
  Conducted multimodal signal analysis for hand gesture classification by integrating EEG and EMG signals. 
  - designed the experimental protocol and implemented synchronous EEG–EMG acquisition during hand gesture tasks.
  - Preprocessed and extracted features, with modality alignment for fusion.
  - Reviewed recent multimodal neural signal processing literature, and reproduced state-of-the-art models including (Bi)LSTM + Attention, CNN-based classifiers, ConvLSTM, Meta-Learning (MAML), and Equivariant MLP (EMLP) frameworks.

* **Top 10% in Kaggle: Stacking Model Competition**, Aug. 2024 -- Sep. 2024  
  *LightGBM, XGBoost, EfficientNet*  
  Designed and implemented a machine learning pipeline to utilize image and tabular data for meta-classification.
  - Explored two methods: one combining multiple ImageNet models with LightGBM, the other utilizing EfficientNet with stacked models (LightGBM, XGBoost, and CatBoost).
  - Conducted 100 extensive experiments, optimizing model parameters and sampling strategies. 
  - Achieved significant improvement in prediction accuracy and stability, earning a bronze medal in the Kaggle competition and ranking in the top 10%.  

Internship
======
* **Peking University Changsha Institute for Computing and Digital Economy**, Apr. 2025 -- Jul. 2025  
  *Algorithm Research Intern, Brain-Computer Intelligence and Applied Statistics Center*
  
  Worked on SEEG-based epileptogenic zone localization and connectivity modeling, integrating signal processing, statistical modeling, and brain network analysis.
  - Computed the Epileptogenicity Index (EI) to identify key nodes and applied MVAR and DTF models to characterize effective connectivity and signal propagation in SEEG data. 
  - Clustered SEEG nodes by functional roles and visualized DTF/PDC networks to analyze spatiotemporal seizure dynamics. 
  - Validated the framework statistically and built a fully automated Python pipeline for data preprocessing, connectivity modeling, and visualization.
